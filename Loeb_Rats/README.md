## Product Goal

The goal of this app is to help facilitate physical and mental health by allowing the citizens of
Ottawa to easily access the schedules and locaions of recreation facilities. Currently, there is a
webapp in Ottawa that provides the locations of recreation ceners, but you are required to go to
each website individually to find the schedules of activities. Our app seeks to streamline this
process by integrating the activities of schedules and the locations of recreation centers.

## User Guide

The design of this app is quite simple. Users are required to enter a number of parameters that will
be used to filter the master schedule to provide relevant search results. These parameters include
current location, either through an address or location services on a device, the age of the user,
the type of activity they are interested in, as well as the desired time and date. The search results
are returned in a list at the bottom of the screen, and as markers on a map. Clicking on the activity
either in the table or on the map will give a description of the activity. This formation includes
start and stop times, address, equipment required, and potential costs.
