**Mission Statement**

Influenza, also known as flu, is a contagious respiratory disease caused by a virus that can be transmitted from person to person [1].  According to a recent survey, Flu had caused about 12,200 hospitalizations and 3,500 deaths in Canada each year [2] and the highest cumulative hospitalization rates are among the following:

- Children under age of 5
- Pregnant women
- People with chronic medical conditions and
- Adults 65 years of age and older.

The Alberta government has long been prepared to fight against the flu in recent decades. The Provincial government has $12.5 million is spent on purchasing 1.6 million doses of influenza vaccine for the 2019-2020 season, which is able to immunize 35% of the population in Alberta [2].

The purpose of our application is to provide a platform that raises citizens&#39; concerns about public health. Our application not only informs its citizens of the latest statistical news about the influenza but also provides an option to report about the same with related agencies/Government. The web application is developed with flu data in Alberta. However, other diseases or pandemics such as coronavirus can also be considered in the application.

**FluInfo Web App Description**

FluInfo is a web application that allows users to access the various categories of influenza related information in Alberta. It includes features like projections of statistical results from governmental organizations, obtaining nearby hospital locations as well as purposeful news and links access health resources and emergency contacts within Alberta. Moreover, this application includes a self-report method that allows users to input their location and their situation to the Government, if they need help. The report feature allows user to communicate useful information or happenings within their region which would be considered as a purposeful way of communication between the government and the user.

**Statistic panels**

There are two statistical results highlighted in the application.

1. Death cases in Alberta:

The number of deaths usually addresses the severity of an epidemic, and is highly concerned by citizens. This part shows the death cases in 5 sub areas of Alberta from August 25th 2019 to February 8th 2020 in a pie chart. Local governments and citizens in a rather severe area may raise their attention to strictly monitor the influenza activities and prevent the flu from spreading. By clicking the setting button on the upper right of this widget, users can choose to show or hide legends and/or data labels. More details will be shown by hovering over different sections of the pie chart.

2. Population vs Immunization in Alberta:

In this section, users would have a clear view on the population of the municipalities and how many people in that sub area are immunized with the influenza vaccines, which is usually an indicator of the flu prevention. Users could show/hide the axes and legends by the setting button. More details will be shown by mouseover.

**Nearby hospital finder**

With all the Alberta hospital locations stored in our application, the users can find and navigate to the nearby hospitals without referring to the address in other applications. The listed hospitals will be refreshed when the user zoom the map to different levels. Users can use their current location or pick any location on the map as the starting location, and pick one of the nearby hospitals in the list as destination. The route and estimated travel time will be displayed.

**Self-report**

In order to help patients with disabilities or unable to get immediate treatment, we created a section called self-report. Users can draw a marker on the map indicating the location of the user and provide the description of report content, such as the symptoms and severity of the flu. The report will be submitted to the database and agents will be able to see the inquiry.

**Information**

On the information panel, we provide the links of Alberta Health and WHO websites of the influenza description and facts. We also provide the link of Alberta Health Services Respiratory Virus Surveillance, which has visualized up-to-date statistics of the influenza cases, hospitalized cases, deaths, immunization doses administered, and other useful updates on the flu. At the bottom of the panel, the contact information of three team members are provided.
