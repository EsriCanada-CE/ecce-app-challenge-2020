**Nathan Slater** (right) has always had a passion for cultivating and developing community. He has spent the greater part of the last eight years working in the outdoor industry as a wilderness leadership instructor, and the last two winters in Halifax completing a bachelor’s degree in Community Design and certificate in Geographic Information Science (GIS). As a certified sea kayak guide, lake canoe instructor, and hike leader, he has spent many hours meticulously looking over maps and charts obsessing over scale, projection, and symbology. This Is the roundabout way in which Nathan entered the world of landform mapping; and later GIS. Since then, he’s been hooked on learning all he can about the methods and applications of spatial statistics and remote sensing. Applications of spatial data in storytelling and impact analysis are Nathan’s main GIS interests. With what little free time he has, Nathan is furiously exploring the rivers, lakes, ocean, and mountains of Nova Scotia and British Columbia. 

**Leah Fulton** (middle) is a fourth-year Bachelor of Community Design, Honours in Urban Design and Planning at Dalhousie University. During her time at Dalhousie University, Leah has had the opportunity to represent Esri Canada as an ECCE Student Associate throughout the last two years. Her skills in GIS analysis and application have enabled her to help solve real-world problems alongside government and university professionals. As a future planner, Leah hopes to use her skills in GIS and social planning research to extend her geographic lens and help those feeling the pressure to live with a focus on Canadian rural and arctic communities. Furthermore, she hopes to advance practice in sustainable economic development for communities with specialized industries. In her spare time, she loves running and cuddling with her dog, Chloe.

**Charles Williams** (left) recently returned to University after 20 years working in the field as a Permaculture designer and land manager. Presently he is attending Dalhousie University dual majoring in Environment, Sustainability and Society (ESS) and a Bachelor of Community Design (BCD) with a focus on applied GI Science. As a lifelong environmentalist and deeply spiritual person Charles is dedicated to connecting people to the natural world. He worries about the growing gap between humans and the environment and looks to use GIS tools to help build bridges between the digital generation and this amazing planet we live on. Outside of school Charles spends most of his time playing with his 4 year old son or teaching permaculture and regenerative land management with Earth Activist Training and the Deanery Project.
