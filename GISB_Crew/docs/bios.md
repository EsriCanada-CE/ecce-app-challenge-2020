My time at Mac and with GIS has been spent between ecology and conservation projects and public health GIS projects. Ready to finish off my degree and time as a student associate in the app challenge!<br style="clear:both;" />

My main focus is using GIS tools to perform analysis on Archaeological topics. I have been highly involved in GIS over the past 3 years and want my final year as a student associate to end off with a bang through this app challenge.<br style="clear:both;" />
