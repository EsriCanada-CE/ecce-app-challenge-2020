# Routing4Safety

## Mission Statement

At *Routing4Safety*, we believe that everybody deserves to come home. We enable users to:

1) generate custom routes that avoid areas with high risk for road collisions, 

2) engage with local traffic collision data to promote public awareness and prevent collisions, and

3) report collisions to support an up-to-date, crowdsourced dataset that promises to keep our service reliable. 

As per the third Sustainable Development Goal focusing on good health and well-being, Routing4Safety is a data-driven, evidence-based solution that aligns with the United Nations’ commitment to halve the number of deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents.

## Stakeholders

The objectives outlined in our mission statement are aligned with Canada’s Road Safety Strategy 2025 that seeks to leverage technology and information to improve road safety, raise public awareness and advocacy for road safety, and also improve collaboration among multiple stakeholders (The Canadian Council of Motor Transport Administrators, 2016)

*Citizens*

*Routing4Safety* enables active transportation opportunities for communities as the routes provided can help reassure families that their loved ones will have a safe journey through the urban environment. Our spatial data on historical collisions provides convincing evidence for which neighborhoods may be safer for road users and citizens may choose to decide where to live, work, and play accordingly. The apps interactive map for the public allows people to do their own analysis of collisions and determine areas of collision concern. They can then advocate for resources to be applied to making those locations safer. Given that it is the public who is most affected by the consequences of collisions, they have a right to be able to consume open collision data in a meaningful way.

*Private Companies*

Road infrastructure is strongly linked to serious injuries and fatalities in road traffic collisions (WHO 2018). Civil engineers engaged in planning, designing, constructing, and maintaining transportation infrastructure can use *Routing4Safety* to understand patterns in collisions as they relate to space and time. For example, the collision data can be used to find areas of high collision density with inadequate infrastructure as a probable cause, the infographics to determine which road surface conditions contribute to the most collisions, and the emerging hot spot analyses to identify where retrofitting infrastructure for road safety should be prioritized.

National charities (such as Parachute, under Desjardins Insurance) are also interested in injury prevention. Establishing partnership with such organizations with the mutual goal of saving lives through traffic safety can make *Routing4Safety* another champion in Canada for Vision Zero, a multi-national traffic safety initiative intended to achieve zero serious injuries and fatalities on the road.

*Government*

The Canadian government recognizes that the built environment can positively or negatively influence many public health issues, including physical activity and injury prevention (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2014). Routing4Safety can inform movements like Canada Walks and the National Active & Safe Routes to School Working Group to help develop a national active transportation strategy. 

## Key Facts

The number of annual road traffic related deaths has reached **1.35 million** and is only steadily increasing, as would be expected with globally increasing urban population and rapid motorization (World Health Organization 2018).

Road traffic injuries are the **leading cause of death** for children and young adults aged 5 to 29 years and the eight leading cause of death for age groups (WHO 2020).

**Over fifty percent** of all traffic deaths involve vulnerable road users: pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists.

Adopted in 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a universal set of goals, targets, and indicators that provides a policy and agenda framework for all United Nations Member states. By addressing global challenges relating to health, inequality, peace and justice, and many more, the seventeen SDGs collectively provide a blueprint for a better world by 2030.

To date, road safety has largely been neglected and collision mitigation efforts have been insufficient in realising progress for the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 3.6 – which calls for a fifty percent reduction in the number of road traffic injuries and fatalities by 2020 (WHO 2018).

The *Global status report on road safety 2018* highlights that number. Every year, approximately 1.35 million people fail to return to their families as a result of a road collision. Those who do survive a road traffic accident, can suffer serious injury and even incur a life-long disability.

## Public Awareness Benefits – Data Visualizations through Infographics and Analyses

Numerous studies have highlighted the importance of public awareness to achieve better road safety outcomes. The data visualizations and statistical infographics provided in Routing4Safety is an innovative use of technology to highlight the importance of traffic safety. As citizens are informed of areas at high risk of collisions and the statistics relating to fatalities, they can be more mindful and attentive towards practicing better road safety practices.

## Public Engagement Benefits – Crowdsourcing Collisions through Survey123

There is significant variation across the world in the rate of road traffic death; for example, while the Americas and Europe have regional rates of 15.6 and 9.3 deaths per 100,000 population respectively, regional rates of road traffic deaths in Africa exceed 25 deaths per 100,000 population (WHO 2018).

Through map-based survey functionality for reporting collisions, *Routing4Safety* can build a detailed and spatially-enabled dataset on collisions for anywhere in the world. As such, this app can not only continue to mitigate collisions in Canadian cities, but also be expanded to and used in low-income countries where there has been no reduction in the number of road traffic deaths since 2013.

Citizens are typically motivated by the desire to aid a worthy cause, and by participating as an informer on road collisions, anyone can advocate for and contribute to the prevention of road traffic injuries and deaths from anywhere (See et al. 2016).

## How to Use *Routing4Safety*

*Access the App and Get Started*

[Lets go to *Routing4Safety*](https://esricanada-ce.github.io/ecce-app-challenge-2020/Safe_Routin_Cowgirls/app/)

Upon opening the app, the user is greeted by an introduction. To proceed, click OK.

If not already centered, click the Home icon to make sure the City of Toronto is clearly displayed within the map extent. Remember, that at any time you can use the plus and minus icons to zoom in or out of the map.

*Choose your Travel Mode and /Current Conditions*

In the “Choose your Mode of Travel and Current Conditions” panel, toggle on the Collisions data.

Next, specify using the drop-down menu if you are the driver of a vehicle or a pedestrian walking to your next destination.

Next, to make sure your planned route is most relevant to current conditions, use the drop-down menus once again to select what the visibility is like, road surface conditions, and whether or not it’s a weekday or weekend, rush hour, or day or night.

*Get Directions*

Next, use the “Directions” panel to enter your origin and destination. There are two ways that you can do this. Either click the location pin and then place your two points on to the map directly, or type your desired addresses or points of interest into the fields.

You can also drag to change the location, or click to see the exact address details.

From the drop-down, choose “Walking Time” or “Distance” based on your preference and click “Get Directions”. 

You can now view the planned route highlighted in the map and also read turn-by-turn directions for assistance in navigation. Your customized route avoids locations where past pedestrian-related collisions have occurred under the conditions you selected.

*Infographics*

Our app also features infographics for you to explore and visualize collision data. To begin, ensure that the collision data is toggled to off, clear any prior directions, choose any one of the many charts available, and click apply.

You can hover over chart elements to view collision count and percentage for each category. On the map, the data points for the chosen category are highlighted in red boxes. You can also click the enlarge icon to view the full chart.

*Emerging Hot Spots*

By clicking the layers icon, you can toggle on analysis layers showing emerging hot spots from all collisions, collisions involving pedestrians, or collisions involving vehicles only. This space-time analysis allows users to foresee future trends in road collisions. 

By clicking the legend icon, you can match the labeled symbology to what you see on the map to understand what the analysis means. Here, we can see that there are major areas in Downtown Toronto that are persistent hot spots, and some parts are either sporadic hot spots or consecutive.

When you’re finished, simply toggle the layers off.

*Survey*

You can also be a road safety informer! If you have witnessed a collision, click the info icon to find a link that directs you to a map-based survey. Simply enter the date and time of the collision, and zoom in to pinpoint and place the collision location. Use the drop-down menus to also easily include information on the type of collision that occurred, and under which visibility, road surface, day, time, and lighting conditions.

The collision reports will be uploaded to the dataset used in the web app on a weekly basis so as to consistently provide users with the most up-to-date information at all times. Including crowdsourcing functionality ensures that data can be collected for anywhere, at any time, the importance of which is demonstrated by the emerging hot spot areas for collisions.

## Summary of the Characteristics of *Routing4Safety*

Routing4Safety provides users with safer routes while commuting, and generates public awareness surrounding collisions in their city. It also acts as a crowdsourcing application for collision occurrences. The map based survey allows users to report collisions that will then be uploaded and incorporated into the existing collisions data. This will ensure that the app's data source is as up to date as possible, and thus that routing is based on the most recent data. The emerging hotspot data shown within our app demonstrates the importance of timely data collection: collision hotspots can change over time.
